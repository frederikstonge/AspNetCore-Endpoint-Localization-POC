# ASP.NET CORE 3 ENDPOINT ROUTE LOCALIZATION AND TRANSLATION

This solution is based on
### Strathweb.Samples.DynamicControllerRouting
Demo code for a blog post [Dynamic controller routing in ASP.NET Core 3.0](https://www.strathweb.com/2019/08/dynamic-controller-routing-in-asp-net-core-3-0/).

The code seemed to have some problems so i added some of mine to get a solution with working link generation from routes
Also now thread language change with route languge and can be levaraged by stringlocalizers.
